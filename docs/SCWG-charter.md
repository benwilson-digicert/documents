# Server Certificate Working Group Charter

Upon approval of the CAB Forum by ballot, the Server Certificate Working Group ("Working Group") is created to perform the activities as specified in this Charter, subject to the terms and conditions of the CA/Browser Forum Bylaws and Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Policy, as such documents may change from time to time. The definitions found in the Forumâ€™s Bylaws shall apply to capitalized terms in this Charter.

**SCOPE:** The authorized scope of the Server Certificate Working Group shall be as follows:

  1. To specify Baseline Requirements, Extended Validation Guidelines, Network and Certificate System Security Requirements, and other acceptable practices for the issuance and management of SSL/TLS server certificates used for authenticating servers accessible through the Internet.

  2. To update such requirements and guidelines from time to time, in order to address both existing and emerging threats to online security, including responsibility for the maintenance of and future amendments to the current CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements, Extended Validation Requirements, and Network and Certificate System Security Requirements.

  3. To perform such other activities that are ancillary to the primary activities listed above.

**OUT OF SCOPE:** The Server Certificate Working Group will not address certificates intended to be used primarily for code signing, S/MIME, time-stamping, VoIP, IM, or Web services. The Server Certificate Working Group will not address the issuance, or management of certificates by enterprises that operate their own Public Key Infrastructure for internal purposes only, and for which the Root Certificate is not distributed by any Application Software Supplier.

**Anticipated End Date:** None.

**Initial chairs and contacts:** Chair, Kirk Hall, kirk.hall@entrustdatacard.com; Vice Chair, Ben Wilson, ben.wilson@digicert.com; terms to run concurrently with their terms as Chair and Vice Chair of the Forum, respectively, unless otherwise voted upon by the Working Group.

**Members eligible to participate:** The Working Group shall consist of two classes of voting members, the Certificate Issuers and the Certificate Consumers. The CA Class shall consist of eligible Certificate Issuers and Root Certificate Issuers meeting the following criteria:

   1) **Certificate Issuer:** The member organization operates a certification authority that has a current and successful WebTrust for CAs audit, or ETSI EN 319 411-1 audit report prepared by a properly-qualified auditor, and that actively issues certificates to Web servers that are openly accessible from the Internet, such certificates being treated as valid when using a browser created by a Certificate Consumer Member. Applicants that are not actively issuing certificates but otherwise meet membership criteria may be granted Associate Member status under Bylaw Sec. 3.1 for a period of time to be designated by the Forum.

   2) **Root Certificate Issuer:** The member organization operates a certification authority that has a current and successful WebTrust for CAs, or ETSI EN 319 411-1 audit report prepared by a properly-qualified auditor, and that actively issues certificates to subordinate CAs that, in turn, actively issue certificates to Web servers that are openly accessible from the Internet, such certificates being treated as valid when using a browser created by a Certificate Consumer Member. Applicants that are not actively issuing certificates but otherwise meet membership criteria may be granted Associate Member status under Bylaw Sec. 3.1 for a period of time to be designated by the Forum.

   3) A **Certificate Consumer** can participate in this Working Group if it produces a software product intended for use by the general public for browsing the Web securely.

The Working Group shall include Interested Parties and Associate Members as defined in the Bylaws.

**Voting structure:** In order for a ballot to be adopted by the Working Group, two-thirds or more of the votes cast by the Certificate Issuers must be in favor of the ballot and more than 50% of the votes cast by the Certificate Consumers must be in favor of the ballot. At least one member of each class must vote in favor of a ballot for it to be adopted. Quorum is the average number of Member organizations (cumulative, regardless of Class) that have participated in the previous three Server Certificate Working Group Meetings or Teleconferences (not counting subcommittee meetings thereof). For transition purposes, if three meetings have not yet occurred, quorum is ten (10).

**Summary of the work that the WG plans to accomplish:** As specified in Scope section above.

**Summary of major WG deliverables and guidelines:** As specified in Scope section above.

**Primary means of communication:** listserv-based email, periodic calls, and face-to-face meetings.

**IPR Policy:** The CA/Browser Forum Intellectual Rights Policy, v. 1.3 or later, SHALL apply to all Working Group activity.
